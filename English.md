    %% Inheritance Relationships
    AdminUser --|> User
    SalesManager --|> User
    WarehouseManager --|> User
    Employee --|> User
    Client --|> User

    %% Associations
    User "1" -- "many" Order : places
    Inventory "1" -- "many" Product : contains
    Order "1" -- "many" Product : includes
```

### Explanation

- **Inheritance**: Specific user roles (`AdminUser`, `SalesManager`, `WarehouseManager`, `Employee`, `Client`) inherit from the `User` base class.
- **Associations**:
  - `User` has a one-to-many relationship with `Order` as users can place multiple orders.
  - `Inventory` holds a collection of `Product` items.
  - `Order` includes multiple `Product` items for each transaction.
